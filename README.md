# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This webapp is a simple game called "evil circle" where 25 balls spawn randomly and bounce around the viewport while a user controlled white circle consumes them.

There are two main modes of function for this program, Standard and Endless modes. Standard mode is selected by default, spawning in 25 balls and counting how many are left on the screen as the evil circle consumes them.

Endless mode can be selected by clicking the button in the top left corner of the web page. Once selected, the button will turn green to indicate that Endless Mode is active. In this mode, a new score counter appears below the button. The game will maintain 25 balls spawned on the page, and the evil circle can consume them endlessly. The score counts the total number of balls consumed.

## Testing
